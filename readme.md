# Countdown Timer

This is a simple countdown timer that will count down to a specified date. This date is specified with (js Date)["http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_dates.asp"] and can be set with a multitude of formats.

The awesome thing about this countdown timer is that it is plain text with no images. The entire thing is html, css and javascript which means that the design can be changed to suit any needs. The css (stylesheet.css) and javascript (script.js) are both customisable without changing the fact that jquery.countdown.js will countdown the days to any given date.

#### limitations
- The current system does not compensate for years. To change this you will need to change jquery.countdown.js to get the year and then display it. This should not be too hard.
- The current system only will go up to 99 days. Again, this should be a simple addition.
